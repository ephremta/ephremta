## Projects

### Credit Scoring Engine for a Digital Lending Platform

- **Tools/Frameworks:** AWS Services, FastAPI, Docker, MLflow, Kubeflow, feast  
- **What it does:** Developed an alternative data-driven credit scoring and configurable decisioning platform for short-tenure loan products. Implemented and deployed multiple machine learning models, establishing fully automated MLOps pipelines for seamless integration and operational efficiency.
- **Evaluation of stability:** Monitored accuracy, performance metrics, and robustness to data shifts and noise. Successfully processed over 1,000,000 requests with response times consistently under 1 second, serving a user base of 60,000 unique customers over a one-year period.

### Implementation of Datalake and Analytics Tool for Financial Report Data

- **Tools/Frameworks:** Redash, AWS Services (S3, EC2, RDS, Lambda), Kedro  
- **What it does:** Developed an ETL pipeline for an edutech company to extract over six years of financial report data and integrate it with their ledger software. Built analytics dashboards to provide actionable insights into financial activities.
- **Usability:** Enabled a 30% increase in user adoption of financial analytics dashboards and reports, leading to a 25% reduction in time spent on data retrieval and analysis.

### End-to-End Monitoring and Evaluation (M & E) KPI Metadata Mapping Data Pipeline

- **Tools/Frameworks:** AWS Services (S3, EC2, RDS, Lambda), Kedro  
- **What it does:** Developed an ETL pipeline for an edutech company to extract their 3-year OKR planning data and integrate it with available resources. Implemented semantic keyphrase embedding and graph techniques to resolve hierarchical-based conceptual data mapping and grouping challenges. Built analytics dashboards for actionable insights into KPI and OKR mapping.
- **Impact:** Enabled a 15% increase in user adoption of KPI and OKR mapping analytics dashboards and reports, with a 10% reduction in time spent on monitoring progress against objectives.

### Personalized Document Support Conversational Bot

- **Tools/Frameworks:** Langchain, FastAPI, JavaScript  
- **What it does:** Integrated OpenAI GPT-3.5 API for document-based question answering, improving accessibility and usability of financial reports and analytics insights. Utilized Langchain with FastAPI and JavaScript to enable natural language interaction, simplifying complex financial data for actionable insights.

### Event and Temporal Information Extraction from Amharic Text

- **Tools/Frameworks:** Python, LSTM, TensorFlow  
- **What it does:** Developed methods to extract event and temporal information from Amharic text. Constructed a dataset of unstructured temporal-triggered news headlines in Amharic. Addressed challenges in disambiguating deverbal nominal entities through rule-based approaches and classical ML models.
